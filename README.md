# Cryptocurrency-Price-Forecasting-Model
This repository will develop a machine learning model to forecast short-term returns in 14 popular cryptocurrencies. Using a dataset of high-frequency market data since 2018, the project aims to predict price movements and gain insights into financial forecasting. 


# Game Plan:

## Data Acquisition:

Data will be pulled from this Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/g-research-crypto-forecasting/overview
The dataset will be explored to understand its structure and content.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

The dataset will be cleaned by handling missing values, outliers, and duplicate records.
Data preprocessing will include normalizing and scaling the time series data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

EDA will be conducted to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
Data visualization using various plots and graphs will provide insights into cryptocurrency price movements.

## Feature Engineering:

New features will be created based on domain knowledge and insights gained from EDA.
Time series features like lagged values, rolling statistics, and technical indicators will be generated for modeling.

## Model Building:

The dataset will be split into training and testing sets.
Various machine learning algorithms such as ARIMA, LSTM, and XGBoost will be experimented with to determine the best approach.
Cross-validation will be used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model.

## Model Evaluation:

The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Error analysis will be performed to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses.

## Model Deployment:

The final model will be saved, and a script for predictions will be created.
The entire process and findings will be documented in a comprehensive report.

## Future Work:

The possibility of incorporating additional data sources to improve model accuracy will be explored.
The project will be kept updated with new findings and improvements.
